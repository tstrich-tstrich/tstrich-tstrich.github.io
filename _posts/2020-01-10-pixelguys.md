A little fighting game I made in Unity. Each character has 6 unique moves with different animations and properties (overheads, lows, etc). Plays a bit like something halfway between Smash and Guilty Gear.<br>
Everything in the game is designed and made by me, except the backgrounds and terrain, which were drawn by the amazing Emma Mathiesen.
I trained a neural net using reinforcement learning and Unity MLAgents to play the game as the CPU. It's... a bit like playing against a younger sibling. <br>
I also wrote the soundtrack, which includes some adaptive music for the actual matches. Various tracks swap in and out depending on which characters are selected, and how much damage each player takes. All the tracks were recorded live in various Los Angeles living rooms.
