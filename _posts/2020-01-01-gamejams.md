I've participated in a variety of little game jam projects. I have had slightly different responsibilities on each:<br>

I wrote and produced the music for this, and also created all the sound effects.<br>

I wrote the adaptive combat music, which is layered and has two different intensities that crossfade. I programmed the audio system which took care of that adaptive music and also contributed to the gameplay programming.<br>

I wrote all the music and did the sound design for this project. I also coded an audio system that swaps the instrumentation for the main gameplay music depending on whether the player is aiming their spacecraft or actively piloting.<br>

I was a gameplay programmer for this project. I programmed the rope throwing and climbing mechanics.
