I worked with fellow composer and dear friend Daniel Montes de Oca Tellez to create the soundtrack for this lovely little game! We produced the tracks in Logic Pro X and Reaper, and I recorded a little bit of saxophone for some of the tracks. The developer, Chaoran Huang, was a great collaborator, shout-out to Chaoran!
